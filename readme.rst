This project is an Aviation Frequency Propagation Simulator, it web-based tool that aids to simulate the coverage of receivers in order to see if there are any blind spots when antennas/recievers are deployed.

The project consist of an admin panel where an admin can add and remove antennas, all the admin needs to do is input the longitude, latitude and coverage radius of the antenna. After that process the admin can then activate or de-activate an antenna.

On the frontend of the project, the user can see the coverage radius of each antenna, as well as where the antenna is deployed aiding the user to understand if there are blind spots and if they can better position their antennas to extract more performance from them.

In order to run the source code, you will need an sql server installed and will need to download the ggv.sql file and import it on your phpmyadmin panel, after that you will need to download the code and add it to your htdocs folder and then you can follow this link to view the frontend on your localhost: http://localhost/GGVAssignment/
